## üìå Task 1 - API Integration and Data Visualization

## üìÑ Description

This task involves fetching data from a **public API** and using **Python** to visualize it in a structured and meaningful way. The OpenWeatherMap API was chosen for this project to extract weather data (such as temperature and humidity forecasts) for a specified city. Once the data was retrieved in JSON format, it was processed and visualized using industry-standard Python libraries.

The goal was to help interns gain practical experience in working with external APIs and understand how to transform raw JSON data into insightful plots using data visualization tools.

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python 3.12
* **Libraries Used:**

  * `requests` - for making API calls
  * `matplotlib` - for creating static visualizations
  * `seaborn` - for enhanced data plots
* **API Used:** OpenWeatherMap ([https://openweathermap.org/forecast5](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5))
* **Editor:** Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
* **Environment:** Windows 10 Command Line / Terminal

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Summary

1. Created a script in Python to access the OpenWeatherMap API with a specified city.
2. Extracted hourly forecast data including timestamps, temperature, and humidity.
3. Parsed and stored this data into Python lists.
4. Plotted line graphs showing:

   * Temperature variation over time.
   * Humidity trend over time.

The script outputs dynamic plots that offer insights into the weather forecast for the next few days in a visually intuitive format.

## üåç Real-World Applications

* **Weather Applications**: Creating basic dashboards to monitor weather patterns.
* **IoT Sensor Monitoring**: Replacing API data with real-time sensor data from connected devices.
* **Travel & Tourism Websites**: Embedding this data to help users plan weather-dependent activities.
* **Educational Projects**: Teaching API integration and visualization concepts to beginners.

## ‚úÖ Deliverables

* A single Python script: `task_1.py`
* Visual plots
