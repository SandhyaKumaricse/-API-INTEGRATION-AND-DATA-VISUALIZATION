##Project Description: API Integration and Data Visualization Using Python

The objective of this project was to integrate a public API using Python and create an interactive and insightful data visualization dashboard using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. For this purpose, I chose the OpenWeatherMap API, which provides real-time weather data for cities across the globe. This task helped deepen my understanding of Python programming, working with APIs, handling JSON data, and visualizing real-world datasets.

Tools and Resources Used:

To successfully complete this project, I used the following tools and sources:

1. OpenWeatherMap API: This was the main source of weather data. I registered on the OpenWeatherMap website to obtain a free API key, which I used to fetch weather data like temperature, humidity, pressure, and weather conditions of different cities.


2. Visual Studio Code (VS Code): This was my primary code editor. It provided an efficient and comfortable environment for writing and testing Python code.


3. GeeksforGeeks: I referred to multiple articles from GeeksforGeeks to understand how API integration works in Python using the requests library, and how to process JSON data structures efficiently.


4. YouTube Tutorials: I watched several tutorial videos on YouTube that explained step-by-step how to interact with APIs, parse data, and plot graphs using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. These visual demonstrations helped clarify concepts and understand potential errors and debugging methods.


5. GitHub Repositories: I explored open-source GitHub repositories with similar projects. This helped me understand project structure, coding practices, and visualization techniques used by other developers.



Process and Implementation:

1. Understanding the Task: The task was divided into two major partsâ€”fetching data from a public API and visualizing it using Python libraries. I first focused on understanding how APIs work and how Python can be used to communicate with them using HTTP requests.


2. Fetching Data: Using the requests library, I created a script that sent a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API and received a JSON response. I extracted relevant data such as temperature, humidity, weather condition, and wind speed.


3. Data Processing: I structured the extracted data using Python dictionaries and lists, which were then converted into a Pandas DataFrame for easy analysis and visualization.


4. Data Visualization: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn, I created several types of visualizations, including:

Line plots for temperature trends

Bar charts comparing weather across cities

Pie charts showing weather conditions

Heatmaps to show correlations between different weather metrics


These visualizations helped in understanding the variation and pattern of weather data more effectively.

Learning Outcomes:

This project enhanced my practical understanding of:

RESTful APIs and HTTP methods

Working with JSON data in Python

Error handling in API requests

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Plotting and customizing graphs using Matplotlib and Seaborn


It was a highly educational experience that combined theory and hands-on coding. The integration of multiple sources like GeeksforGeeks, GitHub, and YouTube was essential in solving real-world programming challenges and gaining confidence in building data-driven Python applications.
